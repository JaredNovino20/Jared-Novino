Hello Everyone:
  I love coding, It's hard specially right now since I'm a begginer. But coding makes me happy, I love the challenged that it gives and the plesure that it gives once you've finish or accomplish something new was worth the effort. I have knowledge in Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, XML, and C++.
